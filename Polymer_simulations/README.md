# Polymer_simulations
This section contains two repositories for:

This repository contains code to perform 1D simulations, which generates LAMMPS files used for 3D molecular dynamics simulations (1D Simulations).

This repository contains example files to generate 3D polymer simulations of loop extrusion with LAMMPS (LAMMPS_3D_polymer_simulations).
