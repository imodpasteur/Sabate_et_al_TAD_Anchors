# Polymer_simulations
This section contains two repositories for:

1. Performing 1D simulations, which generates LAMMPS files used for 3D molecular dynamics simulations (1D Simulations).
2. Generating 3D polymer simulations of loop extrusion with LAMMPS, using example files (LAMMPS_3D_polymer_simulations).
