# LAMMPS 3D polymer simulations
The folder contains an example files used to generate 3D polymer simulations with LAMMPS. 
- initial.py: Generates a file "initial_conformation.txt" containing the atoms, bonds and angles used in the simulations as well as the initial coordinates of the beads
- input_data_generate_f1.py: Defines the random seeds "seed_velocity" and "seed_langevin" and the radius "size_nuc" of the confinement sphere.
- interactions: Defines the potentials between beads.
- simIndex=1.in: Defines the time course and events of the molecular dynamics simulation steps. This .in file is generated by the script runSimulationBeforeLammps.py, described in in Polymer_simulations/1D_simuations. The example file corresponds to a simulation of the L2 locus, with the following parameters: cohesin density = 8 per Mb, cohesin residence time = 18 min, cohesin motor speed = 1 kb/s, CTCF residence time = 150 s, CTCF occupancy = 0.5
- run_Multiple.sh: Sets the number N of independent simulations to run. Create N different folders and copies each file in each folder.

The following packages were used to run the simulations: lammps/2016.11.17 ; gcc/9.2.0 ; openmpi/4.0.5 ; Python/3.8.3. The resulting .dcd files containing bead coordinates were then imported in Python using the MDAnalysis package.
