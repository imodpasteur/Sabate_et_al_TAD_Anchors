# Quantification
LiveCell_Analysis.py quantifies distance time series of TAD anchors. Quality-filtered distance time series can be found at Zenodo (XXX).
The script allows to compute the following:
-	Proximal state segmentation
-	Proximal state fraction
-	Proximal state frequency
-	Proximal state lifetime
-	Closing rate
-	Fractions of proximal, extruding and open states based on an analytical model of coordinate difference distribution.

Other files contain functions used in LiveCell_Analysis.py.
